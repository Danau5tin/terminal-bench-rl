    "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this subnet calculator API task. The user wants a simple API on port 7777 with a GET endpoint /subnet that takes a CIDR and returns subnet info without using networking libraries. So first, I need to plan the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to set up the API. Since it's a simple API and the user mentioned using a Docker container, maybe using a Python Flask or FastAPI would be good. But since the user wants to avoid external libraries, maybe just a basic HTTP server using Python's built-in modules. But wait, for a full-featured API, Flask is more appropriate but it's a external library. Wait, the user said \"no external networking libraries\"â€”does that mean using standard libraries only? So perhaps using Python's http.server or something similar. Hmm, but handling JSON responses and proper endpoints with a custom HTTP server might be tricky. Alternatively, maybe use the standard http.server but build a simple router. Or use a minimal framework like bottle.py, but bottle is an external library. The user wants to implement the binary math themselves but not mention avoiding other libraries. Wait, the user said \"no external networking libraries\", so using built-in libraries like http.server or socket is allowed. But implementing the API with http.server from scratch might take more time. Alternatively, maybe use the CGIHTTPServer and just handle the requests via a CGI script. Hmm, perhaps using a lightweight approach.\n\nWait, the main thing is the subnet calculation. The user wants the binary math to be implemented, so I need to handle the CIDR parsing, calculate the network and broadcast addresses, usable IPs, etc. So the core part is the subnet calculation. Let's focus on that first.\n\nThe steps for the subnet calculator are:\n\n1. Parse the CIDR notation into the base IP and the prefix length.\n2. Convert the IP into its 32-bit integer representation.\n3. Calculate the network address by applying the subnet mask (based on the prefix length) to the IP.\n4. Calculate the broadcast address by inverting the subnet mask and OR-ing with the network address.\n5. Determine the usable IP range (network address +1 to broadcast address -1).\n6. Calculate the number of hosts (2^(32 - prefix length) - 2).\n7. Return all this information as a JSON response.\n\nSo first, I need to handle the CIDR parsing. Let's take \"192.168.1.0/24\" as an example. The prefix is 24, so the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. Then, the network address is 192.168.1.0, broadcast is 192.168.1.255, usable from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. The host count is 254.\n\nImplementing this requires converting the IP address into a 32-bit integer. For that, I can split the IP into octets, then multiply each by the appropriate power of 256 and sum. Then, the network address is the IP ANDed with the subnet mask. The subnet mask can be calculated as (0xFFFFFFFF << (32 - prefix)) & 0xFFFFFFFF. Wait, for prefix 24, 32-24=8, so shifting 32 bits - prefix gives 256 (0xFFFFFF00). So that's how we get the subnet mask as an integer. Then converting that back to dotted notation.\n\nOnce I have the network address, the broadcast is network address | (~subnet_mask) & 0xFFFFFFFF. Because the subnet mask is in 32-bit terms. So for example, subnet mask 0xFFFFFF00 (255.255.255.0), the inverse is 0x000000FF. ORing with the network address gives the broadcast address.\n\nThen, usable IPs are network +1 to broadcast -1. The host count is (broadcast - network) -1.\n\nSo the main functions to implement are:\n\n- parse CIDR into IP and prefix.\n- IP to 32-bit integer.\n- Subnet mask calculation.\n- Network and broadcast address calculations.\n- Convert back to dotted notation.\n\nNow, the API part. The user wants a GET endpoint on port 7777. Using Python, perhaps a minimal HTTP server with a basic routing mechanism. Or using the built-in http.server with a CGI script. But for simplicity, maybe use Flask since it's a common framework and the code would be straightforward. However, the user mentioned not to use external networking libraries, but Flask is in the Python standard library? Wait, no. Flask is an external library, so perhaps that's not allowed. The user probably means that we can't use networking libraries like ipaddress. So need to implement the logic ourselves.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Create a Python script that runs a simple HTTP server on port 7777.\n2. Handle the GET /subnet endpoint, extract the CIDR parameter.\n3. Perform the subnet calculations as outlined.\n4. Return a JSON response with the calculated data.\n\nFor the HTTP server, perhaps use the built-in http.server module. So the script will create a server that handles GET requests. The endpoint will be parsed based on the path and query parameters.\n\nSo first, the steps for the code:\n\n- Parse the URL to check if it's /subnet and extract the CIDR parameter.\n- Validate the CIDR format.\n- Parse the CIDR into IP and prefix.\n- Convert the IP to 32-bit integer.\n- Calculate the subnet mask, network, broadcast, etc.\n- Convert the network and broadcast back to IP addresses.\n- Generate a JSON response with the data.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement each part.\n\nParsing the CIDR: split on '/', the first part is the IP, the second is the prefix. Then validate that the IP is in dotted decimal format and the prefix is between 0-32.\n\nConverting IP to integer: for example, \"192.168.1.0\" becomes (192 << 24) | (168 << 16) | (1 << 8) | 0 = 3232235776.\n\nSubnet mask: for a prefix of 24, the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. So as an integer, it's (0xFF << 24) | (0xFF << 16) | (0xFF << 8) | 0x00 = 0xFFFFFF00.\n\nWait, the subnet mask can be calculated as ((1 << prefix) - 1) << (32 - prefix). For example, prefix 24: 2^24 -1 = 16777215. Shifted left by (32-24)=8 gives 16777215 <<8 = 0xFFFFFF00.\n\nWait, no. Let's see: The subnet mask is a 32-bit number where the first 'prefix' bits are 1s, the rest 0s. So for 24 bits, it's 24 1s followed by 8 0s.\n\nSo the formula is (2^32 - 2^(32-prefix)) +1. Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate mask = (0xFFFFFFFF << (32 - prefix)) & 0xFFFFFFFF.\n\nWait, for prefix 24:\n\n32 - prefix is 8. So shifting 0xFFFFFFFF left by 8 bits gives 0xFFFFFFFF00, but since it's 32 bits, in Python, using bit manipulation, maybe we can do (0xFFFFFFFF << (32 - prefix)) >> (32 - prefix) ? Hmm, maybe another approach.\n\nAnother way: the subnet mask is (2^prefix -1) shifted left by (32 - prefix) bits. Wait, no. For example, prefix 24: 2^24-1 is 16777215. Shifted left by (32-24) =8 gives 16777215 <<8 = 0xFF_FF_FF_00. But since Python uses arbitrary integers, we need to mask it to 32 bits. So mask = ((1 << prefix) -1) << (32 - prefix) & 0xFFFFFFFF. That would give the subnet mask as a 32-bit integer.\n\nYes. So for prefix 24, ((1 <<24) -1) is 0xFFFFFF, shifted left by 8 gives 0xFFFFFF00, which is the correct mask.\n\nSo subnet mask integer is ((1 << prefix) -1) << (32 - prefix) & 0xFFFFFFFF.\n\nOnce we have the subnet mask, the network address is the IP address AND subnet mask. The broadcast is network address OR inverse of subnet mask. But in Python, since integers are of arbitrary size, when inverting, we can mask with 0xFFFFFFFF.\n\nSo for example, subnet_mask = 0xFFFFFF00. inverse_mask = 0xFFFFFFFF - subnet_mask = 0x000000FF.\n\nThen, broadcast = (ip_int | inverse_mask) & 0xFFFFFFFF.\n\nWait, no. The network address is ip & subnet_mask. The broadcast address is network_address | ( (1 << (32 - prefix)) -1 ) -1 ?\n\nWait, the number of hosts is 2^(32 - prefix) -2. So the broadcast address is the last IP in the subnet. So the network address is the first, and broadcast is the last. So the total IPs in the subnet is 2^(32 - prefix). The first is network address, the last is broadcast. The usable IPs are from network +1 to broadcast -1.\n\nSo to compute broadcast, it's network address | inverse_mask. Because inverse_mask is the mask for the host bits. So adding that to the network gives the broadcast.\n\nOnce the network and broadcast are calculated, converting them back to dotted decimal format is needed. For that, split the 32-bit integer into four 8-bit chunks.\n\nSo for example, 3232235776 (192.168.1.0) would be:\n\n3232235776 to hex is 0xC0A80100. Split into 4 bytes: C0 (192), A8 (168), 01 (1), 00 (0). So 192.168.1.0.\n\nThe function to convert an integer to dotted IP would take the integer, split into four bytes, then format them with dots.\n\nNow, the HTTP server part. Using the http.server module in Python, which is a built-in library. So no external libraries needed for that.\n\nCreating a custom request handler that checks the path and query parameters. So for example, when a GET request is made to /subnet?cidr=192.168.1.0/24, parse the query to get the CIDR, then process it.\n\nThe JSON response should include:\n\n- network_address\n- broadcast_address\n- subnet_mask\n- usable_ip_range (as a list of first and last, or as a string like \"start-end\")\n- host_count\n\nSo, the plan is to implement all of this in Python.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\n1. Create a Python script that starts an HTTP server on port 7777.\n2. The server uses a custom request handler that handles GET requests to /subnet.\n3. Parse the query parameters to get the CIDR.\n4. Validate the CIDR format.\n5. Split into IP and prefix.\n6. Convert IP to integer.\n7. Calculate subnet mask, network, broadcast.\n8. Convert network and broadcast back to dotted notation.\n9. Compute usable IP range and host count.\n10. Return a JSON response with all the data.\n\nLet me outline the code structure.\n\nFirst, the HTTP server:\n\nWe can use the BaseHTTPServer module in Python 3 (http.server). The CustomRequestHandler will handle the GET requests.\n\nIn the do_GET method, we check the path. If it's /subnet, then parse the query parameters.\n\nParsing the query parameters can be done using urlparse and parse_qs.\n\nThen, process the CIDR.\n\nNow, code for the subnet calculation.\n\nImplementing the functions:\n\ndef cidr_to_subnet_info(cidr):\n    ip_str, prefix_str = cidr.split('/')\n    prefix = int(prefix_str)\n    ip_parts = ip_str.split('.')\n    ip_int = (int(ip_parts[0]) << 24) + (int(ip_parts[1]) << 16) + (int(ip_parts[2]) << 8) + int(ip_parts[3])\n    subnet_mask = ((1 << prefix) -1) << (32 - prefix) & 0xFFFFFFFF\n    network = ip_int & subnet_mask\n    broadcast = (network | (~subnet_mask & 0xFFFFFFFF)) & 0xFFFFFFFF\n    host_count = (broadcast - network) - 1\n    # Convert subnet_mask to dotted notation\n    mask_bytes = [(subnet_mask >> 24) & 0xFF, (subnet_mask >> 16) & 0xFF, (subnet_mask >> 8) & 0xFF, subnet_mask & 0xFF]\n    mask_str = '.'.join(map(str, mask_bytes))\n    # Convert network to dotted\n    network_ip = '.'.join(map(str, [(network >> 24) & 0xFF, (network >> 16) & 0xFF, (network >> 8) & 0xFF, network & 0xFF]))\n    # Similarly for broadcast\n    broadcast_ip = '.'.join(map(str, [(broadcast >> 24) & 0xFF, (broadcast >> 16) & 0xFF, (broadcast >> 8) & 0xFF, broadcast & 0xFF]))\n    usable_start = network + 1\n    usable_end = broadcast - 1\n    usable_range = f\"{ip_from_int(usable_start)}-{ip_from_int(usable_end)}\"\n    return {\n        'network_address': network_ip,\n        'broadcast_address': broadcast_ip,\n        'subnet_mask': mask_str,\n        'usable_ip_range': f\"{ip_from_int(network + 1)}-{ip_from_int(broadcast - 1)}\",\n        'host_count': host_count\n    }\n\nWait, need a helper function to convert an integer to dotted IP. Also, for usable IP range, we need to convert the integers back to IP strings.\n\nSo, helper function:\n\ndef ip_from_int(ip_int):\n    return '.'.join(map(str, [(ip_int >> 24) & 0xFF, (ip_int >> 16) & 0xFF, (ip_int >> 8) & 0xFF, ip_int & 0xFF]))\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nNow, the HTTP server code.\n\nIn Python, the code could be:\n\nfrom http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer\nimport urllib.parse\n\nclass SubnetHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def do_GET(self):\n        if self.path.startswith('/subnet'):\n            try:\n                # Parse the query\n                parsed = urllib.parse.urlparse(self.path)\n                query_params = urllib.parse.parse_qs(parsed.query)\n                cidr = query_params.get('cidr', [None])[0]\n                if not cidr:\n                    self.send_response(400)\n                    self.send_header('Content-type', 'application/json')\n                    self.end_headers()\n                    self.wfile.write(b'{\"error\": \"Missing cidr parameter\"}')\n                    return\n                # Process the CIDR\n                info = self.calculate_subnet_info(cidr)\n                # Send response\n                self.send_response(200)\n                self.send_header('Content-type', 'application/json')\n                self.end_headers()\n                self.wfile.write(self.jsonify(info).encode('utf-8'))\n            except Exception as e:\n                self.send_response(500)\n                self.send_header('Content-type', 'application/json')\n                self.end_headers()\n                self.wfile.write(f'{{\"error\": \"{str(e)}\"}}'.encode('utf-8'))\n        else:\n            self.send_response(404)\n            self.send_header('Content-type', 'text/plain')\n            self.end_headers()\n            self.wfile.write(b'404 Not Found')\n\n    def calculate_subnet_info(self, cidr):\n        ip_str, prefix_str = cidr.split('/')\n        prefix = int(prefix_str)\n        ip_parts = ip_str.split('.')\n        if len(ip_parts) !=4:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid IP format\")\n        ip_parts = [int(p) for p in ip_parts]\n        for p in ip_parts:\n            if p <0 or p>255:\n                raise ValueError(\"Invalid IP octet\")\n        ip_int = (ip_parts[0] << 24) + (ip_parts[1] << 16) + (ip_parts[2] <<8) + ip_parts[3]\n        subnet_mask = ((1 << prefix) -1) << (32 - prefix)\n        subnet_mask &= 0xFFFFFFFF # mask to 32 bits\n        network = ip_int & subnet_mask\n        broadcast = (network | (~subnet_mask & 0xFFFFFFFF)) & 0xFFFFFFFF\n        host_count = (broadcast - network) -1\n        mask_ip = self.int_to_ip(subnet_mask)\n        network_ip = self.int_to_ip(network)\n        broadcast_ip = self.int_to_ip(broadcast)\n        usable_start = self.int_to_ip(network +1)\n        usable_end = self.int_to_ip(broadcast -1)\n        return {\n            'network_address': network_ip,\n            'broadcast_address': broadcast_ip,\n            'subnet_mask': mask_ip,\n            'usable_ip_range': f\"{usable_start}-{usable_end}\",\n            'host_count': host_count\n        }\n\n    def int_to_ip(self, ip_int):\n        return '.'.join(map(str, [(ip_int >> 24) & 0xFF, (ip_int >> 16) & 0xFF, (ip_int >> 8) & 0xFF, ip_int & 0xFF]))\n\n    def jsonify(self, data):\n        return json.dumps(data)\n\nimport json\n\ndef run_server():\n    server_address = ('', 7777)\n    httpd = HTTPServer(server_address, SubnetHandler)\n    print(\"Starting server on port 7777...\")\n    httpd.serve_forever()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    run_server()\n\nWait, but in the code above, the HTTPServer is using port 7777 as specified. So this script can be run, and it will start the server on that port.\n\nNow, testing. Let's test with 192.168.1.0/24.\n\nThe network address should be 192.168.1.0, subnet mask 255.255.255.0, broadcast 192.168.1.255, host count 254, usable IPs from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254.\n\nAnother test case: 10.0.0.0/8.\n\nSubnet mask is 255.0.0.0, network is 10.0.0.0, broadcast is 10.255.255.255, host count 16777214.\n\nPotential issues to handle:\n\n- CIDR with invalid format (e.g., no slash, invalid prefix).\n- IP addresses with octets >255.\n- Prefix outside 0-32.\n\nIn the code, the CIDR is split on '/', then the prefix is parsed as integer. Then the IP is split into four parts and each is converted to integer and validated.\n\nBut in the code above, the calculate_subnet_info function may not be handling leading zeros or other edge cases. Also, the subnet mask calculation when prefix is 32: (1<<32)-1 is 4294967295, shifted left by 0 bits, so subnet_mask is 4294967295. So for a /32, the network is the IP itself, broadcast is same as network. Then host_count would be 0.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the host count is 2^(32 - prefix) -2. For /32, it's 2^(0) -2 = 1-2 = -1, but according to our code, host_count is (broadcast - network) -1, which is 0-0-1 = -1. That's a problem.\n\nWait, the correct formula for the number of usable hosts is 2^(32 - prefix) -2. So for /32, it's 1-2 = -1, which is invalid. So we need to handle that. Similarly, for /31 and /32, but in practice, /31 and /32 are for point-to-point links and loopback, but the formula should account for that.\n\nIn our code, for /32, host_count would be (broadcast - network) -1. Since network and broadcast are the same, it's 0 -1 = -1, which is incorrect. So we need to adjust the host count calculation to ensure that when 32 - prefix is 0 (i.e., 2^0 is 1), the host count is 1-2 = -1, but according to the problem statement, we need to return the host counts as per the standard. But in reality, for /32, the number of hosts is 0 (since you can't have a host address, it's a single IP, no usable hosts).\n\nSo in the code, the host count calculation should be (2^(32 - prefix) - 2), but only if 32 - prefix >0. So for 32 - prefix =0 (i.e., prefix 32), the host count is 0.\n\nSo in the code, the host_count can be calculated as:\n\nhost_bits = 32 - prefix\nif host_bits ==0:\n    host_count = 0\nelse:\n    host_count = (1 << host_bits) -2\n\nWait, (1 << host_bits) is 2^host_bits. Then minus 2 for the network and broadcast.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nhost_count = (1 << host_bits) - 2 if host_bits >0 else 0\n\nSo updating the code's host_count calculation.\n\nIn the code, after calculating host_bits = 32 - prefix.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nhost_bits = 32 - prefix\nhost_count = (1 << host_bits) -2\nif host_bits ==0:\n    host_count = 0\n\nBut wait, when host_bits is 0, (1 <<0) is 1, minus 2 is -1. So setting it to 0 makes sense.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nhost_count = (1 << (32 - prefix)) -2\nif (32 - prefix) ==0:\n    host_count = 0\n\nSo in the code, in the calculate_subnet_info function, we can calculate host_count as:\n\nhost_count = (1 << (32 - prefix)) - 2\nif 32 - prefix ==0:\n    host_count = 0\n\nThis will handle the /32 case.\n\nAnother issue: the current code calculates host_count as (broadcast - network) -1. For /24, network is 3232235776, broadcast is 3232235776 | 0x000000FF = 3232236031. 3232236031 -3232235776 =255. Then 255 -1 = 254, which is correct. But using (1 << (32 - prefix)) -2 is better for correctness in all cases.\n\nSo perhaps the code should use this formula for host_count.\n\nUpdating the code:\n\nhost_bits = 32 - prefix\nhost_count = (1 << host_bits) -2\nif host_bits ==0:\n    host_count = 0\n\nThen return host_count.\n\nThis will handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, updating the code's host_count calculation.\n\nAlso, the usable IP range is from network +1 to broadcast -1. For /32, this would be network +1 to broadcast -1, but since network == broadcast, this would be 0 to -1, which is invalid. So for host_bits ==0, the usable range can be an empty string or omitted. But the problem statement requires returning the usable IP range. So perhaps in the response, if host_count <=0, the usable range is empty. So the code should check and handle that.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nif host_count <=0:\n    usable_range = \"\"\nelse:\n    usable_start = network +1\n    usable_end = broadcast -1\n    usable_range = f\"{ip_from_int(usable_start)}-{ip_from_int(usable_end)}\"\n\nBut this requires checking.\n\nSo integrating all these into the code.\n\nNow, the code may need to be tested for edge cases. But since the user wants the code to be implemented, the code is written to handle these cases.\n\nNow, the HTTP server code is in Python using the built-in modules, no external libraries used.\n\nNow, the code can be written in a file, say app.py.\n\nNow, to run the server, the command would be:\n\npython3 app.py\n\nThen, accessing http://localhost:7777/subnet?cidr=192.168.1.0/24 would return the JSON response.\n\nSo the task is to write this code and test it.\n\nNow, to create the file app.py with the code, and then run it.\n\nThe user is in a Docker container, so they can create the file and run it.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Create a new Python file app.py with the server code.\n2. Run the server using python3 app.py.\n3. Test the API endpoint.\n\nBut the user may need to run it in the background. However, since they are using tmux, they can start the server in a tmux session.\n\nBut the steps for the user would be:\n\n- Write the code to a file.\n- Execute the server.\n- Test with curl.\n\nSo, the first action is to create the file app.py with the correct code.\n</think>\n\n```xml\n<todo>\noperations:\n  - action: add\n    content: \"Create subnet calculator API in Python\"\n  - action: add\n    content: \"Implement CIDR parsing and subnet calculations\"\n  - action: add\n    content: \"Write HTTP server on port 7777 to handle /subnet GET requests\"\n  - action: add\n    content: \"Validate CIDR input format and error handling\"\nview_all: true\n</todo>\n```"

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by creating the Python file for the API. I need to use a text editor like nano to write the code. The file should be named something like subnet_calculator.py.\n\nWait, the user mentioned the HTTP server should run on port 7777. So I'll need to set up a simple HTTP server using Python's built-in modules like http.server and urllib.parse. But since the user wants to avoid external libraries, I can't use Flask or anything else. So I'll have to write a custom handler.\n\nNext, the core logic for parsing CIDR, calculating network and broadcast addresses, and generating the JSON response. Let me think about the steps for the CIDR calculation. The CIDR string is split into the IP and prefix. The IP is converted to a 32-bit integer, then apply the subnet mask. The subnet mask can be calculated as ((1 << prefix) - 1) << (32 - prefix). But I need to mask it with 0xFFFFFFFF to ensure it's 32 bits.\n\nThen, the network address is the IP AND subnet mask. The broadcast address is network OR (INVERTED subnet mask). Then, the usable IPs are from network +1 to broadcast -1. The host count is (broadcast - network) -1. But I need to handle edge cases like /32, which has no usable hosts.\n\nAlso, I need to convert the integer back to dotted IP format. For example, converting 3232235776 to 192.168.1.0.\n\nTesting with an example: 192.168.1.0/24. The subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. Network is 192.168.1.0, broadcast is 192.168.1.255. Usable IPs from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. Host count is 254.\n\nI should also add input validation to check for valid CIDR format, valid IP octets, and prefix between 0 and 32.\n\nNow, putting this into code. The HTTP handler will check the path, parse the query parameter, process the CIDR, and return a JSON response. I'll use json.dumps to generate the JSON.\n\nLet me outline the code structure:\n\n- Import necessary modules: http.server, urllib.parse, json, os.\n- Define the request handler class that inherits from BaseHTTPRequestHandler.\n- Implement do_GET method to handle the /subnet endpoint.\n- Parse the CIDR parameter from the query string.\n- Split the CIDR into IP and prefix.\n- Convert the IP to a 32-bit integer.\n- Calculate the subnet mask, network, broadcast.\n- Convert back to IP strings.\n- Compute host count and usable range.\n- Return JSON response with the data.\n\nWait, but how to handle the case where the CIDR is invalid? Need to catch exceptions and return 400 or 500 errors.\n\nTesting the code with curl would be good, but since I'm in a Docker container, I can start the server and test it.\n\nSo, the next step is to create the Python script, then start the server, and then test it. But first, write the code.\n\nLet me start writing the code in a file called app.py.\n</think>\n\n```xml\n<file>\naction: write\nfile_path: \"app.py\"\ncontent: |\n  from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer\n  import urllib.parse\n  import json\n\n  class SubnetHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n      def do_GET(self):\n          if self.path.startswith('/subnet'):\n              parsed = urllib.parse.urlparse(self.path)\n              query_params = urllib.parse.parse_qs(parsed.query)\n              cidr = query_params.get('cidr', [None])[0]\n              \n              if not cidr:\n                  self.send_error(400, \"Missing cidr parameter\")\n                  return\n              \n              try:\n                  ip_str, prefix_str = cidr.split('/')\n                  prefix = int(prefix_str)\n                  if prefix < 0 or prefix > 32:\n                      raise ValueError\n                  ip_parts = list(map(int, ip_str.split('.')))\n                  if len(ip_parts) != 4 or not all(0 <= p <= 255 for p in ip_parts):\n                      raise ValueError\n                  \n                  # Convert IP to 32-bit integer\n                  ip_int = (ip_parts[0] << 24) | (ip_parts[1] << 16) | (ip_parts[2] << 8) | ip_parts[3]\n                  \n                  # Calculate subnet mask (32-bit value)\n                  subnet_mask = ((1 << prefix) - 1) << (32 - prefix)\n                  subnet_mask &= 0xFFFFFFFF  # Ensure 32-bit masking\n                  \n                  # Calculate network and broadcast addresses\n                  network = ip_int & subnet_mask\n                  inverse_mask = (~subnet_mask) & 0xFFFFFFFF\n                  broadcast = (network | inverse_mask) & 0xFFFFFFFF\n                  \n                  # Convert to dotted IP strings\n                  def int_to_ip(addr):\n                      return f\"{(addr >> 24) & 0xFF}.{(addr >> 16) & 0xFF}.{(addr >> 8) & 0xFF}.{addr & 0xFF}\"\n                  \n                  network_ip = int_to_ip(network)\n                  broadcast_ip = int_to_ip(broadcast)\n                  subnet_mask_ip = int_to_ip(subnet_mask)\n                  \n                  # Calculate usable IP range\n                  usable_start = network + 1\n                  usable_end = broadcast - 1\n                  usable_range = f\"{int_to_ip(usable_start)}-{int_to_ip(usable_end)}\" if usable_start <= usable_end else \"\"\n                  \n                  # Calculate host count\n                  host_count = (1 << (32 - prefix)) - 2 if (32 - prefix) > 0 else 0\n                  \n                  # Prepare response\n                  response_data = {\n                      \"network_address\": network_ip,\n                      \"broadcast_address\": broadcast_ip,\n                      \"subnet_mask\": subnet_mask_ip,\n                      \"usable_ip_range\": usable_range,\n                      \"host_count\": host_count\n                  }\n                  \n                  self.send_response(200)\n                  self.send_header('Content-Type', 'application/json')\n                  self.end_headers()\n                  self.wfile.write(json.dumps(response_data).encode())\n              \n              except (ValueError, IndexError):\n                  self.send_error(400, f\"Invalid CIDR format: {cidr}\")\n          else:\n              self.send_error(404, \"Endpoint not found\")\n\n      def log_message(self, format, *args):\n          return  # Suppress request logging\n\n  def run_server():\n      server_address = ('', 7777)\n      httpd = HTTPServer(server_address, SubnetHandler)\n      print(\"Server running on port 7777...\")\n      httpd.serve_forever()\n\n  if __name__ == '__main__':\n      run_server()\n</file>\n```"

The usable range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 is also accurate.\n\nSince the test case worked, the API seems to be functioning as required. I should confirm that the server is running and responding correctly. The next step is to ensure that the server continues to run and handle other CIDR inputs as well.
