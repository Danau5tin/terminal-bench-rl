    "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this venv repair task. First, I need to understand the problem. The user says the venv at /app/venv is corrupted after a failed upgrade. They want to repair it by extracting the actually used packages from the src/ imports and rebuild it with only necessary dependencies, keeping the editable installs from local-packages/ intact. Also, document the fixes in venv-repair-report.txt.\n\nAlright, my first thought is that I need to figure out which packages are currently in use in the project. Since the user mentioned checking src/ imports, I should look through the Python files in the src directory to see which external packages are being imported. That way, I can determine which ones are necessary.\n\nSo the plan would be:\n\n1. Identify which packages are imported in the src/ codebase. This can be done using grep or some kind of static analysis. Maybe using grep for lines that start with 'import' or 'from' and look for packages not in the standard library.\n\n2. Check the existing environment for installed packages. Since the venv is corrupted, maybe I can list the current packages before removing them, but the user might not want to rely on that since the upgrade failed. Alternatively, if the user can run pip freeze, but if the venv is corrupted, maybe pip is broken. Hmm. So maybe step 1 is the main way to find necessary packages.\n\n3. Then, create a list of those necessary packages, perhaps generate a requirements.txt based on that.\n\n4. Rebuild the venv from scratch, install the necessary packages and the editable ones from local-packages.\n\nBut also, need to document the fixes in venv-repair-report.txt.\n\nLet me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find all the packages imported in src/*.py files. Let's think about using grep. The command could be something like:\n\ngrep -rE '^import ([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)' src/ | awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq\n\nBut also check for 'from' statements:\n\ngrep -rE '^from ([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)' src/ | awk -F'[ .]' '{print $2}' | sort | uniq\n\nBut that might be tricky because 'from' statements have the module path. For example, 'from django.utils import something' would extract 'django.utils', but the package is 'django'. So maybe need a better way.\n\nAlternatively, use a tool like pipreqs which can parse the imports and find dependencies. But since I can't install packages if the venv is corrupted, maybe I need to use the existing system's pip. Wait, but in a Docker container, maybe pip is installed.\n\nAlternatively, I can run a Python script that lists the imported packages and their installed paths. But that might require running the code, which might not be possible if the venv is broken.\n\nAlternatively, use grep to collect all the import names and then cross-check them against the standard library to find non-stdlib packages.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the packages used in the imports.\n\nAnother approach: Use a static analysis tool like 'parso' or 'ast' module in Python to parse the files and extract imports. But that might be complicated without a working venv.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps proceed with a grep-based approach, followed by filtering out standard library packages.\n\nSo, first step: Use grep to find all imports in the src directory.\n\nThen, sort them, remove duplicates, and cross-check with the standard library to see which are external packages.\n\nNext, create a requirements.txt of those packages. However, some packages might be in local-packages/ as editable installs. So I need to exclude those from the requirements.txt, as the user wants to keep the editable installs intact.\n\nSo the process would be:\n\n1. Collect all imports from src/ and identify external packages.\n\n2. Generate a list of those packages to install via pip.\n\n3. Remove the existing corrupted venv.\n\n4. Create a new venv.\n\n5. Install the necessary packages from the list.\n\n6. Install the local-packages/ as editable with pip install -e.\n\n7. Document all these steps in venv-repair-report.txt.\n\nPotential issues to consider:\n\n- The grep might miss some imports if they're dynamically loaded (e.g., using importlib or conditional imports), but static analysis via grep is a start.\n\n- Some packages might have different names in the import versus the PyPI name, so the user might need to adjust the requirements accordingly, but perhaps that's beyond the scope here.\n\n- The existing environment might have other dependencies that are not used in the src/ but are installed. However, the user wants to keep only necessary deps, so this step should filter out those.\n\nAnother thing: The user might have dependencies that are part of the local-packages/ which are editable installs, so those should not be included in the requirements.txt. So when generating the list, need to exclude any packages that are in local-packages/.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Find all import statements in src/ and extract the package names.\n\n2. Filter out standard library packages and any from local-packages/.\n\n3. Create a requirements.txt with the remaining packages.\n\n4. Remove the old venv.\n\n5. Create new venv and install requirements.txt.\n\n6. Install editable packages from local-packages/.\n\n7. Document the process in the report file.\n\nNow, to implement this in a Docker container with a tmux session.\n\nFirst, I need to do the grep command. Let's start by running:\n\ngrep -r --include='*.py' 'import \\|from ' src/ \n\nBut perhaps better to extract the actual package names. Alternatively, use a script or tool like pipreqs.\n\nWait, pipreqs can generate a requirements.txt based on the imports in a project directory. However, if the venv is corrupted, maybe pipreqs isn't installed. But in a Docker container, maybe it's available, or I can install it temporarily.\n\nBut since the user wants to rebuild the venv, perhaps the best approach is to use pipreqs in the current environment, assuming it's working enough to run that command. If not, proceed with grep.\n\nAlternatively, run pipreqs in the current environment to generate the requirements, but that might include the corrupted packages. However, the user wants to extract from the src/ imports, so perhaps using pipreqs on the src/ directory would be better.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Install pipreqs if not already present: pip install pipreqs\n\nBut if the venv is corrupted, maybe the global pip is not available. But in a Docker container, maybe it is.\n\nAssuming that pip is working, then:\n\npipreqs /path/to/src --encoding=utf-8 --exclude local-packages/ --force\n\nThis would generate a requirements.txt listing the external packages used in the src/ directory, excluding those in local-packages/.\n\nThen, proceed to rebuild the venv.\n\nBut first, need to check if the local-packages/ are already in the src/ imports, but the user wants to keep them as editable. So the generated requirements.txt should not include those, as they are in local-packages/.\n\nBut the user wants to keep the editable installs from local-packages/ intact. So during the rebuild, after creating the new venv, install the editable packages.\n\nSo steps in code:\n\n- Backup current venv (maybe, but user might not want that, so perhaps proceed to delete)\n\n- Remove old venv directory.\n\n- Create new venv: python3 -m venv /app/venv\n\n- Activate it.\n\n- Install the requirements from the generated requirements.txt.\n\n- Then, install editable packages from local-packages/ via pip install -e .\n\nBut the user might have multiple editable installs, so perhaps loop through local-packages/ and install each as editable.\n\nNow, putting this all together in the Docker environment.\n\nFirst, generate the requirements.txt using pipreqs, then rebuild the venv.\n\nSo the initial actions would be:\n\n- Check if pipreqs is installed. If not, install it via pip (but the current venv is corrupted, maybe the global pip can be used, or use the system pip).\n\nBut if the user is in a Docker container, maybe the base image has pip installed. Alternatively, use the following command to install pipreqs globally:\n\npip install --upgrade pip pipreqs\n\nBut if the current venv is broken, maybe using the system pip (outside the venv) to install pipreqs temporarily.\n\nBut since the user is operating within a Docker container, maybe the global pip is available.\n\nSo, first action: install pipreqs.\n\nThen, generate the requirements.txt.\n\nThen, create the new venv, install requirements, then install the local editable packages.\n\nBut need to make sure to exclude local-packages/ from the requirements.txt, as those are to be installed as editable.\n\nThe user wants to keep the editable installs intact, so the generated requirements should not include those packages.\n\nTherefore, when using pipreqs, exclude the local-packages/ directory.\n\nSo the command would be:\n\npipreqs /app/src --exclude /app/local-packages --force\n\nThis would generate a requirements.txt in the current directory.\n\nThen, delete the old venv, create new one, install requirements, then install local editable packages.\n\nFinally, document the steps in venv-repair-report.txt.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The user may have dependencies not present in the src/ imports, like runtime dependencies of other dependencies, but the user wants only the ones actually used in the src/ imports. However, the generated requirements.txt would only include those directly used in the src/ code.\n\n- If the local-packages/ are part of the import path, but the user wants them to be installed as editable, they should not be in the requirements.txt. The pipreqs --exclude should prevent that.\n\nOnce all this is done, the report should be written to venv-repair-report.txt, detailing the steps taken.\n\nNow, the plan for the agent's actions.\n\nFirst, check if pipreqs is installed. If not, install it. Then generate the requirements.\n\nBut in the Docker container, maybe the user has pip available. So first, install pipreqs.\n\nBut if the current venv is corrupted, perhaps the user can run pip install globally. So the command would be:\n\npip install pipreqs\n\nThen, generate the requirements.txt.\n\nNext, check the generated requirements.txt for any local-packages packages that were not excluded. Then proceed to rebuild the venv.\n\nThen, remove the old venv, create new, install requirements, install editable packages.\n\nAlso, the report file needs to be created, documenting all the steps and changes.\n\nSo, the todo list would include:\n\n1. Install pipreqs if not present.\n\n2. Generate requirements.txt using pipreqs, excluding local-packages.\n\n3. Remove the old venv directory.\n\n4. Create a new venv.\n\n5. Install the requirements from requirements.txt.\n\n6. Install editable packages from local-packages/.\n\n7. Document all steps in venv-repair-report.txt.\n\nNow, in the Docker environment, the agent will need to execute these steps via bash commands.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- The src directory might not be in /app/src. Need to confirm the path.\n\n- The local-packages might be in a different location.\n\nAssuming the project structure is as follows:\n\n- src/ contains the main code.\n\n- local-packages/ contains editable packages.\n\nBut the exact paths may vary, but based on the user's message, the venv is at /app/venv, so maybe the project is in /app/ as well.\n\nSo, the paths would be /app/src, /app/local-packages, and /app/venv.\n\nSo the agent's first step is to install pipreqs.\n\nThen generate requirements.txt in the current directory.\n\nThen, proceed with the venv removal and setup.\n\nNow, the todo list in YAML format.\n\nFirst, the agent needs to perform the actions step by step, using bash commands and file operations.\n\nBut the agent must first create the todo list.\n\nSo the initial todo list would be:\n\n- Install pipreqs.\n\n- Generate requirements.txt with pipreqs.\n\n- Remove the old venv.\n\n- Create new venv.\n\n- Install requirements.\n\n- Install editable packages.\n\n- Document in report.\n\nBut each of these needs to be a concrete todo entry.\n\nNow, translating this into the required XML todo format.\n</think>\n\n<todo>\noperations:\n  - action: add\n    content: \"Install pipreqs to generate requirements from src/ imports\"\n  - action: add\n    content: \"Generate requirements.txt excluding local-packages/ using pipreqs\"\n  - action: add\n    content: \"Remove corrupted virtual environment at /app/venv\"\n  - action: add\n    content: \"Create new virtual environment at /app/venv\"\n  - action: add\n    content: \"Install base dependencies from generated requirements.txt\"\n  - action: add\n    content: \"Install editable packages from local-packages/ as development versions\"\n  - action: add\n    content: \"Create venv-repair-report.txt documenting all repair steps and decisions\"\n  - action: add\n    content: \"Verify repair by running basic import checks from src/ directory\"\nview_all: true\n</todo>"

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by installing pipreqs. The user mentioned the venv is corrupted, but maybe the global pip is still working. So I'll run 'pip install pipreqs'. If that fails, I might need to find another way, but let's try it first.\n\nNext, I need to generate the requirements.txt. Using pipreqs in the src directory, excluding local-packages. So the command would be 'pipreqs /app/src --exclude /app/local-packages --force'. This should list all dependencies used in src that aren't in local-packages. But wait, I should check if pipreqs is installed now. If the first step worked, then yes.\n\nThen, remove the old venv. The user said it's corrupted, so 'rm -rf /app/venv' should do it. Then create a new one with 'python3 -m venv /app/venv'.\n\nAfter that, activate the venv and install the requirements from the generated file. The requirements.txt is in the current directory, so 'pip install -r requirements.txt' inside the activated venv.\n\nNext, install the editable packages from local-packages. Assuming each is in a directory there, use 'pip install -e' for each. So find all .egg-info directories or check the setup.py files in local-packages and run 'pip install -e .' in each. Maybe use a loop or a bash command to handle that.\n\nDocumenting in venv-repair-report.txt will require writing each step, so I can append to that file after each action. Finally, verify by trying to import modules from src. For example, run 'python -c \"import module\"' to check if imports work now.\n\nWait, but I need to handle the environment correctly. The venv's Python might not be active unless I source it. So after creating the venv, I should source the activate script. But in the Docker container, maybe the PATH is set correctly, but better to specify the full path to the venv's pip and python.\n\nSo, the steps in code would be:\n\n1. Install pipreqs: pip install pipreqs\n2. Generate requirements: pipreqs /app/src --exclude /app/local-packages --force\n3. Remove old venv: rm -rf /app/venv\n4. Create new venv: python3 -m venv /app/venv\n5. Activate and install dependencies: /app/venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt\n6. Install editable packages: cd /app/local-packages && find . -type d -name 'setup.py' | xargs -I{} sh -c 'cd {}; pip install -e .'\n7. Document each step in venv-repair-report.txt with timestamps\n8. Verify with import checks: python /app/src/main_script.py or similar commands to test imports\n\nBut I need to make sure each step is executed correctly. If any step fails, like the pipreqs command, I might need to adjust. Also, the paths must be correct. Assuming the local-packages are under /app/local-packages, and src is under /app/src. Let's proceed with these steps.\n</think>\n\n<bash>\ncmd: 'pip install pipreqs'\n</bash>"

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to proceed with the next steps after successfully installing pipreqs. The next todo is to generate the requirements.txt excluding local-packages using pipreqs. So, I should run the pipreqs command in the src directory. Let me check the syntax.\n\nThe command should be something like pipreqs /path/to/src --exclude /path/to/local-packages. Since the user mentioned the venv is at /app/venv, probably the project is in /app, so the src directory is /app/src and local-packages is /app/local-packages. I need to make sure the paths are correct.\n\nSo the command would be pipreqs /app/src --exclude /app/local-packages --force. The --force flag is needed to overwrite existing files. Let me verify if that's the correct approach. Yes, pipreqs documentation says to use --force if you want to regenerate the requirements even if it already exists.\n\nAfter generating the requirements.txt, the next step is to remove the corrupted venv. The command is rm -rf /app/venv. Then create a new one with python3 -m venv /app/venv. Then install the requirements. But first, I need to make sure that the requirements.txt was generated correctly. If the user has dependencies that are in local-packages, they should be excluded from the requirements.txt now.

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, so the user is trying to repair a corrupted virtual environment. The first step was to generate a requirements.txt file using pipreqs, which scanned the src directory and excluded the local-packages. The output from the last command showed that pipreqs successfully created the requirements.txt in /app/src, but there were some warnings about missing imports.\n\nLooking at the warnings, \"myutil\" wasn't found on PyPI, which might be a local package or a typo. The user wants to keep local-packages intact, so maybe \"myutil\" is in local-packages. Also, other packages like click, numpy, pandas, etc., were resolved correctly. Since the requirements.txt was generated, the next step is to remove the old venv and create a new one.\n\nThe user's todo list includes removing the old venv at /app/venv. So I should run 'rm -rf /app/venv' to delete it. Then create a new venv with 'python3 -m venv /app/venv'. After that, activate the venv and install the requirements. But wait, in the Docker container, the Python version might be 3.13, so using 'python3' should be okay. \n\nOnce the venv is created, I need to install the dependencies from the requirements.txt. So activate the venv and run 'pip install -r /app/src/requirements.txt'. Then, install the editable packages from local-packages. The user mentioned keeping editable installs from local-packages, so I should navigate into each package directory in local-packages and run 'pip install -e .' for each. \n\nBut how to do that in one command? Maybe use a loop: 'for d in /app/local-packages/*; do pip install -e \"$d\"; done'. That should handle all packages in local-packages. \n\nAfter installing, the next step is to create the venv-repair-report.txt. The user wants documentation of the fixes. So I'll need to note the steps taken, the packages installed, and any issues encountered like the missing 'myutil'. Also, verify the repair by running some imports from src. \n\nWait, the user's todo also includes verifying by running basic import checks. So maybe run a simple Python script that imports modules from the src code to ensure everything works. \n\nPutting it all together, the next actions are: delete the old venv, create new, install requirements, install editable packages, document, and verify. Let me structure the bash commands accordingly.\n</think>\n\n<bash>\ncmd: 'rm -rf /app/venv && python3 -m venv /app/venv && /app/venv/bin/pip install -r /app/src/requirements.txt'\n</bash>"

The error says that neither 'setup.py' nor 'pyproject.toml' was found in the myutil directory. That means the package isn't properly structured for editable installation.\n\nFirst, I need to check why the myutil package doesn't have those files. Maybe the user didn't generate them, or the directory structure is wrong. Since the user mentioned keeping editable installs intact, perhaps the local-packages were supposed to have their own setup files.\n\nI should look into the local-packages directory to see what's inside. Let me use the 'ls' command to check the contents. That way, I can see if there are other packages with the correct setup files or if myutil is the only one missing them.\n\nIf other packages do have setup files, then the problem is specific to myutil. Maybe the user forgot to create them. In that case, I need to guide the user to generate a setup.py or pyproject.toml for myutil. But since I can't interact with the user, I have to proceed with the available information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the packages in local-packages are not intended to be installed via pip, but rather included in the source code another way. But the user's task is to install them as editable, so the setup files are necessary.\n\nAnother possibility is that the path is incorrect. The loop is going through each directory in local-packages, but perhaps the packages are in subdirectories, or the names are incorrect. For example, maybe the correct package is in a different directory name, or the .egg-info is not part of the package structure.\n\nI should check the structure of the local-packages directory to verify the actual package names and their contents. Using the 'ls' command with the -R option can show all subdirectories and files, helping identify any misconfiguration.\n\nOnce the structure is clear, I can adjust the installation command to target the correct packages with the proper setup files. If myutil is indeed missing them, the next step is to inform the user to create those files, but since I can't do that here, I might need to proceed without myutil if it's not essential.\n\nAlternatively, if myutil is a placeholder or a directory with the correct setup files in a different location, the path in the command might need adjustment. For example, maybe the correct setup.py is in a subdirectory of myutil.\n\nIn summary, the immediate action is to inspect the local-packages directory's structure to identify why the installation is failing. Once the cause is known, the installation command can be adjusted accordingly. For now, using 'ls' on local-packages will provide the necessary details to proceed.\n</think>\n\n<bash>\ncmd: 'ls -R /app/local-packages'\n</bash>"

The error message mentioned that neither 'setup.py' nor 'pyproject.toml' was found for 'myutil' and 'myutil.egg-info'. But looking at the ls output, there's a setup.py in the root of /app/local-packages.\n\nWait, the packages in local-packages are 'myutil' and 'myutil.egg-info'. The setup.py is in the root directory, not inside myutil. That's probably the problem. The 'myutil' directory is the actual package, but the setup.py is in the parent directory.\n\nSo when the loop tries to install each directory as editable, it's going into 'myutil' and 'myutil.egg-info', but the setup.py isn't there. The correct setup.py is in the local-packages directory. So the loop is incorrect.\n\nI need to adjust the command. Instead of installing each subdirectory, the setup.py is in the root of local-packages. So the correct package is the 'myutil' directory, but the setup.py is in the parent. So the user probably ran 'pip install -e .' from the local-packages directory, which would work because setup.py is there.\n\nSo the error is because the loop is trying to install each subdirectory as if they contain setup.py, but they don't. Instead, the correct approach is to install the 'myutil' package from the local-packages directory where setup.py is located.\n\nSo the correct command should be to install 'myutil' as an editable package from the local-packages directory. So change the loop to run 'pip install -e .' from /app/local-packages. That way, it uses the setup.py in that directory.\n\nWait, the ls shows setup.py is in /app/local-packages. So the package is 'myutil' and the setup.py is in the same directory. But the loop was trying to enter each subdirectory and install from there. So the correct package path is just '/app/local-packages', and the command should be 'pip install -e /app/local-packages'.\n\nAlternatively, if the setup.py is in /app/local-packages, then running 'pip install -e .' in that directory would install the package. So the loop is unnecessary. So the fix is to change the command to install from the local-packages directory itself, not its subdirectories.\n\nTherefore, the correct bash command is to run 'cd /app/local-packages && /app/venv/bin/pip install -e .' to install the myutil package as editable using the setup.py located there.\n</think>\n\n<bash>\ncmd: 'cd /app/local-packages && /app/venv/bin/pip install -e .'\n</bash>"

If there's an error, I need to address it, but given the previous steps, I think it's likely working now.\n</think>\n\n<bash>\ncmd: 'python3 -c \"import myutil; import pandas; import numpy; print(\\\"Import checks passed\\\")\"'\n</bash>"

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user tried to run import checks but got a ModuleNotFoundError for 'myutil'. Hmm, why is that happening? Let me check the steps taken so far.\n\nEarlier, when installing the local-packages, the setup.py was in /app/local-packages, and the command 'pip install -e .' was run from there. The output showed that 'myutil' was installed successfully. But now, when trying to import, it's not found.\n\nWait, maybe the package name in setup.py is different. Let me check the setup.py in /app/local-packages. If the package is named 'myutil' in setup.py, but the directory is 'myutil', then the import should work. But perhaps the package is not properly structured. Maybe the __init__.py is missing or the package name is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the venv is not activated. The user is using /app/venv/bin/python, right? Let me check the import in the correct environment. Also, the 'myutil' might be installed in a different directory. Let me look at the site-packages in the venv to see if 'myutil' is there.\n\nAnother possibility: when installing as editable, the package is linked as a development egg, so the name might be different. Maybe the package is installed as 'myutil-0.1.0' but the import uses 'myutil'.\n\nWait, the pip install output showed 'Successfully installed myutil-0.1.0', so the package name is correct. Maybe the issue is with the Python path. Let me check if the venv is activated when running the import check. The previous command used 'python3', which might not be the venv's Python. Should use the full path to the venv's Python binary.\n\nYes, the correct approach is to use '/app/venv/bin/python' instead of just 'python3' to ensure the venv is active. Let me adjust the command accordingly.\n</think>\n\n<bash>\ncmd: '/app/venv/bin/python -c \"import myutil; import pandas; import numpy; print(\\\"Import checks passed\\\")\"'\n</bash>"

The steps taken so far include generating a requirements.txt from the src directory, excluding local packages, creating a new venv, installing the base dependencies, installing the local packages as editable, and verifying the imports.\n\nThe last step was running an import check using the venv's Python, which passed. So, the repair seems successful. The report file was created, documenting all the steps. The user's main goal was to have a working venv with necessary dependencies and local packages intact. Since the import checks passed, the venv is functional now.\n\nI should confirm that all steps were completed and the final verification was successful. There's no indication of further issues, so the task can be considered done. The response should summarize the repairs and confirm success.\n</think>\n\n<finish>\nmessage: \"Venv repaired successfully.
