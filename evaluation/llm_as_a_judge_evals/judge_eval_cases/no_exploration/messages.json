    "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a script called resume_backup.sh that resumes a backup process by copying only the remaining files not listed in the state file. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe source directory is /app/data/ and the destination is /backup/data/. The state file is /backup/backup.state, which contains a list of files already copied. The script should copy files that aren't in the state file.\n\nFirst, I need to find all files in /app/data/ and compare them against the entries in the state file. The challenge is to efficiently determine which files are missing from the state file.\n\nI should generate a list of all files in the source directory. Using find /app/data/ -type f would get all files. Then, compare this list with the state file. The files not present in the state file are the ones to copy.\n\nBut how to compare them? Using grep -vF -x to exclude lines that match the state file. The -F option treats the pattern as a fixed string, -x matches the whole line, and -v inverts the match, so only lines not in the state file are kept.\n\nSo the command would be find /app/data/ -type f | grep -vF -x -f /backup/backup.state. This gives the list of files to copy.\n\nThen, for each file in this list, perform the copy using cp. But to make it efficient, maybe use rsync instead of cp, as rsync can resume transfers and is more efficient for large data. However, the user mentioned that the script should skip already copied files. Since the state file already tracks what's been copied, maybe cp is sufficient here. Wait, but if the script is resuming, maybe rsync's --files-from option would be better.\n\nAlternatively, construct a list of files to copy and then use xargs to pass them to cp. But if there are many files, xargs might split into multiple commands. Using -I {} to handle each file individually.\n\nWait, but the state file might have paths relative to /app/data/ or absolute paths? The example uses /backup/data/, so perhaps the state file contains absolute paths. So when generating the list of files to copy, the find command would output absolute paths, and the state file entries are also absolute paths. That way, the comparison is accurate.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Generate list of all files in /app/data/.\n2. Subtract the files listed in /backup/backup.state.\n3. For each remaining file, copy it to /backup/data/ (or maybe the same directory structure under /backup/data/). Wait, the original backup script was copying files from /app/data/ to /backup/data/, so the destination directory should mirror the source. So when copying, the destination path should be /backup/data/ plus the relative path from /app/data/. For example, a file /app/data/subdir/file.txt should be copied to /backup/data/subdir/file.txt.\n\nTherefore, when copying, we need to preserve the directory structure. Using cp -r would handle directories, but since we're dealing with individual files, maybe using cp with the destination directory constructed by replacing /app/data/ with /backup/data/ in the source path.\n\nSo for each file, the destination path is ${file//\\/app\\/data\\//\\/backup\\/data\\/}. But in a shell script, we can use parameter expansion to replace the prefix.\n\nSo in the script, for each file in the list of files to copy, do:\n\ncp \"$file\" \"/backup/data/${file#\\/app\\/data\\/}\"\n\nBut need to handle cases where the directory structure doesn't exist in the destination. So create the necessary directories. For example, if the source file is /app/data/a/b/c.txt, the destination is /backup/data/a/b/c.txt. So before copying, create /backup/data/a/b if it doesn't exist.\n\nTo do that, for each file, extract the directory part and create it in the destination.\n\nSo, for each file:\n\ndest_dir=\"/backup/data/${file#\\/app\\/data\\/}\"\ndest_dir=\"${dest_dir%/*}\"\n\nmkdir -p \"$dest_dir\"\ncp \"$file\" \"$dest_dir/\"\n\nBut how to handle this in the script. The script can iterate over each file, create the destination directory, then copy the file.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe script resume_backup.sh would:\n\n- Use find to get all files in /app/data/\n- Use grep to exclude those in the state file\n- For each remaining file, create the destination directory and copy the file.\n\nSo the steps in the script would be:\n\nfind /app/data/ -type f | while read -r file; do\n    if ! grep -qF \"$file\" /backup/backup.state; then\n        # Process the file\n        dest=\"${file//\\/app\\/data\\//\\/backup\\/data\\/}\"\n        dest_dir=$(dirname \"$dest\")\n        mkdir -p \"$dest_dir\"\n        cp \"$file\" \"$dest\"\n        echo \"$file\" >> /backup/backup.state\n    fi\ndone\n\nWait, but this approach would read each file from the find command and check against the state file. However, using grep -qF inside the loop could be inefficient if the state file is large. The initial approach with grep -vF -x -f is better for efficiency.\n\nAlternatively, generate the list of files to process once, then iterate over them. So:\n\nfiles_to_copy=$(find /app/data/ -type f | grep -vF -x -f /backup/backup.state)\n\nThen, iterate over each file in files_to_copy.\n\nBut in a shell script, handling this could be done with a while loop reading from the output.\n\nSo the script would be:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Find all files in the source directory not in the state file\nfiles_to_copy=$(find /app/data/ -type f | grep -vF -x -f /backup/backup.state)\n\n# Process each file\necho \"$files_to_copy\" | while read -r file; do\n    # Generate the destination path\n    dest=\"${file//\\/app\\/data\\//\\/backup\\/data\\/}\"\n    dest_dir=$(dirname \"$dest\")\n    # Create destination directory if needed\n    mkdir -p \"$dest_dir\"\n    # Copy the file\n    cp \"$file\" \"$dest\"\n    # Update the state file\n    echo \"$file\" >> /backup/backup.state\ndone\n\nBut wait, appending to the state file during the copy might cause issues if the script is interrupted again. However, the user's original setup already has a state file, and this script is supposed to resume. So by appending to the state file after each successful copy, the state is updated. However, if the script is interrupted during the copy, the state file might have entries for files that weren't successfully copied. That could be a problem. To handle this, maybe only append to the state file after the file is successfully copied.\n\nBut in the script above, the file is added to the state file immediately after the copy command. If the copy fails (e.g., due to permission issues), the state file would still have the entry, leading to the file being skipped even though the copy failed. To mitigate this, perhaps check the exit status of the cp command and only add to the state file if it succeeds.\n\nSo modify the script to:\n\ncp \"$file\" \"$dest\" && echo \"$file\" >> /backup/backup.state\n\nThis way, the state file is updated only if the copy was successful.\n\nAnother consideration: the state file should be updated atomically. If the script is interrupted during the append, the state file could be in an inconsistent state. However, given that this is a simple script, and the user's state file is already in use, this approach might be acceptable for the problem at hand.\n\nNow, writing the script:\n\nThe script should be a bash script, so start with #!/bin/bash.\n\nPutting it all together, the resume_backup.sh would look like:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Find all files in /app/data/ not listed in the state file\nfiles_to_copy=$(find /app/data/ -type f | grep -vF -x -f /backup/backup.state)\n\n# Process each file to copy\necho \"$files_to_copy\" | while read -r file; do\n    # Generate destination path\n    dest=\"${file//\\/app\\/data\\//\\/backup\\/data\\/}\"\n    dest_dir=$(dirname \"$dest\")\n    \n    # Create destination directory if it doesn't exist\n    mkdir -p \"$dest_dir\"\n    \n    # Copy the file and update state if successful\n    if cp -p \"$file\" \"$dest\"; then\n        echo \"$file\" >> /backup/backup.state\n    else\n        echo \"Failed to copy $file\" >&2\n    fi\ndone\n\nWait, using cp -p preserves timestamps and attributes, which might be useful if the backup needs to maintain those. The user didn't specify, but it's a good practice.\n\nAlso, the -x option in grep ensures that only exact lines are matched. The -F option treats the pattern as a fixed string, not a regex. This is important because the state file entries are likely to contain literal filenames, not regex patterns.\n\nNow, testing this script:\n\n- The find command lists all files in /app/data/.\n- The grep -vF -x -f /backup/backup.state excludes files present in the state file.\n- For each remaining file, the destination is constructed by replacing /app/data/ with /backup/data/, preserving the directory structure.\n- The destination directory is created with mkdir -p.\n- The file is copied, and if successful, added to the state file.\n\nThis should efficiently resume the backup by only copying files not already in the state.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n1. Files with spaces or special characters in their names. The use of read -r in the loop handles lines with spaces correctly, as each line is read as a single entry. However, if the state file or find command outputs lines with newlines in filenames, this could be an issue. Since the state file is generated by the original script, and assuming it's correctly written (one file per line), the script should handle standard filenames.\n\n2. The state file may have trailing newlines or empty lines. Using grep -vF -x -f would ignore empty lines because -x requires the entire line to match. If the state file has empty lines, they are not considered as valid file paths, so they don't affect the comparison.\n\n3. Performance: If the source directory has a huge number of files, the find command may take time, and the grep command could be slow. However, given that the user is resuming a backup, this is a one-time process and the script should be efficient enough for the scenario.\n\nAnother point: The script appends to the state file as it copies each file. If the script is interrupted again, the next run will skip the files that were partially processed. However, any files that were copied but not added to the state file would be copied again. The script's current approach ensures that the state file is only updated after a successful copy, so this should be handled.\n\nNow, writing the script to /resume_backup.sh. The user wants the script to be called resume_backup.sh, so create it with the above content and make it executable.\n</think>\n\n```xml\n<todo>\noperations:\n  - action: add\n    content: \"Create resume_backup.sh script to copy remaining files not in state file\"\n  - action: add\n    content: \"Test script logic with find, grep, and cp commands\"\n  - action: add\n    content: \"Ensure directory structure is preserved in /backup/data/\"\n  - action: add\n    content: \"Verify state file is updated after successful file copy\"\n  - action: add\n    content: \"Make script executable\"\nview_all: true\n</todo>\n```\n\n```xml\n<file>\naction: write\nfile_path: \"/resume_backup.sh\"\ncontent: \"#!/bin/bash\\n\\n# Find files in source not in state file\\nfiles_to_copy=$(find /app/data/ -type f | grep -vF -x -f /backup/backup.state)\\n\\n# Process each file\\necho \\\"$files_to_copy\\\" | while read -r file; do\\n    # Generate destination path\\n    dest=\\\"${file//\\\\/app\\\\/data\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/backup\\\\/data\\\\/}\\\"\\n    dest_dir=\\\"$(dirname \\\"$dest\\\")\\\"\\n    \\n    # Create destination directory\\n    mkdir -p \\\"\\$dest_dir\\\"\\n    \\n    # Copy file and update state if successful\\n    if cp -p \\\"\\$file\\\" \\\"\\$dest\\\"; then\\n        echo \\\"\\$file\\\" >> /backup/backup.state\\n    else\\n        echo \\\"Failed to copy \\$file\\\" >&2\\n    fi\\n\\ndone\\n\"\n</file>\n```\n\n```xml\n<bash>\ncmd: \"chmod +x /resume_backup.sh\\n\"\n</bash>\n```\n\n```xml\n<finish>\nmessage: \"Created resume_backup.sh script that efficiently copies only uncopied files by comparing against the state file.
