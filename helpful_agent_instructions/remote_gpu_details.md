If you are reading this, then it is important you keep these details in mind for the chat you are in with the user right now.

- The user has a single node GPU instance or cluster with multiple GPUs running
- There is a connection to this cluster in a separate ssh window
- Therefore you cannot run cmds on the cluster.
- What you can do though is provide the cmds you want to run to the user, they will execute them on the cluster, and return the outputs to you
